# Ephemeral Hubs for NASA Communities

Ephemeral hubs in the cloud deliver interactive computing services for NASA affiliated communities. This technology provides the foundations for social collaboration and interoperability necessary for a new era of *open-source science*.

## Service Offering

Two types of services are available for NASA researchers, educators and learners.

### [Open Science BinderHub](services/open-hub.md)

<!-- TODO: Insert screenshot of landing page of the open science hub -->
:::

Researchers can use the [Open Science BinderHub](services/open-hub.md) to interactively view and share an approved selection of NASA affiliated code repositories that deliver *light scientific content* with small compute and no barriers to authentication.

### [Leto BinderHub](services/leto-hub.md)

<!-- TODO: Insert screenshot of landing page of the Leto hub -->
:::

Researchers can log into [Leto](services/leto-hub.md) to access a BinderHub with more *substantial compute resources* to interactively investigate large datasets and run large workflows from any code repository.

:::{admonition} What is BinderHub?
:class: note, dropdown
[BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the software infrastructure that allows users to access and share reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories in the cloud.

Code repositories that are BinderHub-ready can be referred to as a *binder*, much like a real-life ring binder that holds documents together üìí.

[mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) is an open federation of BinderHub services operated by a team of volunteers.
